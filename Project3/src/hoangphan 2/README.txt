This project is done by Hoang Phan.
This is an individual project about binary expression trees.

Tasks done:
- Read the input and recognize the type of each expression.
- Convert the current expression into the other two of these types (prefix, infix, postfix)
- Display the level order notation of that expression
- Print the binary expression tree graphically

Errors checked:
- The first character of each expression must be either '!', '@', or '#'
- All operands are single alphabet characters (lowercase and uppercase)
- All operators include '+', '-', '*', '/', and '^'
- Each character of a line is separated by a single space

Hours done: about 20 hours
